# codex-gpt3
An AI :robot: tool made using GPT-3. This was made by following this [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/2FeymQoKvrk), and then changed and expanded upon by myself.

## Instructions:
### Setup
1. Make sure to run npm install in client and server to get all the dependencies.
2. Get your own API key from https://platform.openai.com.
3. Once you have it, create a .env file in the server folder and add this line: OPENAI_API_KEY="[your api key here]"
4. Use npm run dev to start the client, and npm run server to boot the server.

### Using the app
* Ask the AI almost anything by using the message box at the bottom.
* Add the tag IMG (case sensitive) anywhere in your message to get a generated image based on your prompt.
